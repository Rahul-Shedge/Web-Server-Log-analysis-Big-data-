# Web-Server-Log-analysis-Big-data-
 Web server log analysis with Hadoop,Mapreduce,Pig & Sqoop.
 
Assume you host an e-commerce website. In order to understand your customers better, you want
to analyse your Apache web logs to discover how people are finding your site. The web server
logs, however, are too large to import into a MySQL database, and they are not in a relational
format,So need another way to analyse them.

## The compressed file contains the client requests captured by a Web server looks like:
 21.125.155.111 - - [01/Jan/2012:12:07:48 +0530] "GET /digital-cameras/digital-camera/sony-qx-dsc-qx100-point-shoot-digital-camera-black.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1470    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17" "-"


 The Weblog file contains 1L records.

 
### Problem statements:
1. Parse logs and convert request string into structured format (/a/b/c/d  =>  a	b	c	d)
50.57.190.149	-	-	22/Apr/2012:07:12:41 +0530	GET /computers/laptops.html?brand=819 HTTP/1.0	computers	-	-	laptops.html	brand=819	200	12530	-	-

2. count of page views by individual user

3. Top / Bottom 5 :  catagery-1/ catagery-2 / page / user-agent / referal / users / entry pages / exit pages / 
(Exclude status code other than 200, also exclude record related to css/js/image)

4. Total pageviews / Category wise pageviews / Unique pageviews

5. count of status code = 200 / 404 / 400 / 500



My Approach for the solution of problem statements & code is mentioned in Proof OF Concept(POC) pdf.
